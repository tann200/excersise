# library_excersise
This is a small test using Page object model in TestNG to create a book into a library and verify its existance by book ID.
I tried to have this project be buildable in gradle, so it can be used with tools like Jenkins or Bamboo later.


Usage:
1. Copy or clone the repository
2. In UNIX, Open the terminal, go to the repository folder and use: ./gradlew test.
3. In Windows, open the command line, go to the repository folder and run gradle.bat

Alternatively open the project in an IDE and run the test.

This test could use better logging and multiple testsuites, but since this is my first try at TestNG with Java
and Selenium Webdriver, it would take more time to learn how to best utilize the framework.
